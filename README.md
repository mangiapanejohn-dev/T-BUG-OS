## What is Resonix - Skill?

Resonix - Skill is a comprehensive framework for building intelligent AI agents with:

- 🧠 **Multi-layer Memory System** - Episodic, semantic, procedural, and working memory
- 📚 **Autonomous Learning** - Continuous knowledge acquisition and synchronization  
- 🔧 **Skill System** - Modular, reusable capabilities
- ⚡ **Workflow Automation** - Heartbeat and cron-based automation
- 🎯 **Proactive Behavior** - Self-directed action and decision making

## Features

### Memory System

| Type | Storage | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| Episodic | `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` | Event/session records |
| Semantic | `./semantic/` | Knowledge and concepts |
| Procedural | `Skills/` | Skills and workflows |
| Working | `HEARTBEAT.md` | Current tasks |
| Meta | `MEMORY.md` | Long-term highlights |

### Learning System

- **Passive Learning** - From user interactions
- **Active Learning** - Self-initiated discovery  
- **Scheduled Learning** - Cron-based acquisition
- **Sources** - Web search, browsing, APIs, documents

### Skill System

- Modular skill definitions
- Auto-discovery
- Lazy loading
- OpenClaw integration

### Workflows

- **Heartbeat** - Periodic background checks during active sessions
- **Cron Jobs** - Scheduled tasks
- **Event Triggers** - Condition-based execution

## Documentation
